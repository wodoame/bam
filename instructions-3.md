# 🏦 Bank Account Management System (BEM03)

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Time Estimate** | 6-8 hours |
| **Technology Stack** | Java 21 (LTS), IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition |

This lab builds directly on Week 2, enhancing the Bank Account Management System by introducing modern Java features:

  * Migration from arrays to Java Collections for more efficient, scalable data management.
  * Integration of Functional Programming (Lambdas, Functional Interfaces, Method References, Streams API) for concise, functional-style data processing.
  * Implementation of File I/O and NIO (Path API) for persistent storage of accounts and transactions.
  * Use of Regular Expressions (Regex) for validating inputs (account numbers, emails, etc.).
  * Introduction to Concurrency Fundamentals with threads and synchronized methods for thread-safe transactions.

All data is now managed in-memory using Collections and processed via functional streams, then saved/loaded from text files. This lab prepares the foundation for future persistence using databases and multi-threaded service simulations.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

  * Use `ArrayList` and `HashMap` for efficient account and transaction storage.
  * Apply Lambdas, Streams, and Functional Interfaces to perform filtering, mapping, and reduction on collections.
  * Apply File I/O (NIO Paths & Files) for saving and loading account data persistently.
  * Implement Regex-based validation for customer info and account formats.
  * Demonstrate basic concurrency with threads and synchronized methods.
  * Maintain thread safety and avoid data corruption during concurrent transactions.
  * Design code that's modular, reusable, and ready for future database integration.

## ✨ System Features Overview

Your system now includes five advanced features:

### Feature 1: Collections Migration with Functional Programming

  * Replace arrays with `ArrayList` and `HashMap<String, Account>`.
  * Implement efficient search, insert, and update operations.
  * Support sorting transactions by date or amount using comparators and Streams.
  * Use Lambda expressions for concise iteration and transformation of data.

### Feature 2: File Persistence with Functional Stream Processing

  * Save all accounts and transactions to files (`accounts.txt`, `transactions.txt`).
  * Load data automatically on startup.
  * Use Java NIO `Files` and `Paths` APIs for reading/writing.
  * Process loaded data using Streams and Method References for mapping lines into `Account` and `Transaction` objects.

### Feature 3: Regex Validation

  * Validate account numbers (`ACC\d{3}`), emails, and phone numbers.
  * Display user-friendly errors for invalid input formats.
  * Centralize validation logic in `ValidationUtils`.
  * Optionally, apply `Predicate` lambdas for dynamic validation rules.

### Feature 4: Thread-Safe Concurrent Transactions

  * Use `Thread` and `synchronized` to simulate multiple deposits/withdrawals.
  * Demonstrate concurrency by running simultaneous operations safely.
  * Prevent race conditions and data inconsistencies.
  * Optionally, use parallel streams for batch transaction simulations.

### Feature 5: Enhanced Console Experience

  * Show data load/save confirmation messages.
  * Display thread activities in real time.
  * Maintain readable logs for file operations and thread actions.

## 💻 Console UI Examples

### Main Menu (Extended)

```
BANK ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Main Menu:
1. Manage Accounts
2. Perform Transactions
3. Generate Account Statements
4. Save/Load Data
5. Run Concurrent Simulation
6. Exit

Enter your choice:
```

### Collections Load Confirmation

```java
Loading account data from files...

35 accounts loaded successfully from accounts.txt
20 transactions loaded from transactions.txt
```

### Regex Validation Example

```java
Enter customer email: john.smith@bank
X Error: Invalid email format. Please enter a valid address (e.g., name@example.com)

Enter customer email: john.smith@bank.com

Email accepted!
```

### Concurrent Deposit Simulation

```java
Running concurrent transaction simulation...

Thread-1: Depositing $500 to ACC001
Thread-2: Depositing $300 to ACC001
Thread-3: Withdrawing $200 from ACC001

Thread-safe operations completed successfully.
Final Balance for ACC001: $6,850.00
```

### Functional Filtering Example

```java
transactions.stream()
.filter(t -> t.getType().equals("DEPOSIT"))
.sorted(Comparator.comparing(Transaction::getAmount).reversed())
.forEach(System.out::println);

Output:
Transactions filtered and sorted using Streams and Lambdas.
```

### File Save Confirmation

```java
SAVING ACCOUNT DATA

Accounts saved to accounts.txt
Transactions saved to transactions.txt
File save completed successfully.
```

### Statement Generation (from Collections)

```java
GENERATE ACCOUNT STATEMENT

Enter Account Number: ACC003

Account: Emily Brown (Checking)
Current Balance: $1,240.00
Transactions (latest first):

TXN019 | DEPOSIT | +$300.00 | $1,240.00
TXN018 | WITHDRAWAL | -$200.00 | $940.00

Net Change: +$100.00
```

### Application Exit

```java
Thank you for using the Bank Account Management System!
Data automatically saved to disk.
Goodbye!
```

2.  Use Streams to perform filtering and sorting.
3.  Verify improved speed and concise syntax.

### Workflow 3: Regex Validation and Error Handling

2.  Re-enter valid data → accepted.
3.  Verify all inputs conform to patterns.

### Workflow 4: Concurrent Transaction Simulation

1.  Select "Run Concurrent Simulation."
2.  Threads or parallel streams deposit/withdraw simultaneously.
3.  Observe interleaved logs.
4.  Verify final balances are accurate and thread-safe.
